# Hi, I'm KT! 👋

🪄 Transitioning my career into Tech because I truly enjoy programming.  
🩵 Dreaming of studying Computer Science at university one day.  
💗 By day, I work in my field of study — by night, I code passionately.  
🌐 My first love is **Cybersecurity**, but right now I'm deeply driven by **Web Programming**!
